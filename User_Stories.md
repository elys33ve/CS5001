As a research scientist, I want to accelerate my machine learning model's inference time so that I can process large datasets more quickly.

As a data analyst, I want to reduce the power consumption of a neural network so that I can deploy my model in an energy-constrained environment.

As a researcher, I want to measure the performance of a software algorithm on an FPGA so that I can prove the benefits of hardware acceleration.
