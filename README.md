## Project Code
### [linux-zynqmp](/linux-zynqmp/)
Linux kernel code with drivers and device tree (dts) for the hardware platform that will be used for the acceleration testing. 
### [ip](/ip/)
Ip cores that will perform the bus transfers between the FPGA logic and the CPU, and userspace code for both the accelerated and unaccelerated test systems.
### [platform_boot]
Binaries for the first stage boot loader (fsbl), u-boot, fpga programming files and the Linux kernel. The corresponding kernel drivers are installed from the build tree (linux-zynqmp).
### [utils-3eg]
FPGA project files for AMD/Xilinx Vivado 2025.1. where the ip cores are instantiated and a binary produced to program the FPGA.
