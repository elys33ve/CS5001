Team Meetings:
We’ll aim to hold virtual meetings with all members at least once a week to discuss objectives, address challenges, and track progress. Meeting frequency, location, and individual members present may vary.

Project Focus:
Hardware acceleration: we’ll research and quantify the benefits of migrating a compute-intensive machine learning algorithm to a hardware accelerator. We’ll measure and compare the performance, power consumption, and latency of a software-only implementation against a hardware-accelerated version.
- Develop CPU-only software; analyse performance and identify bottlenecks.
- Use HLS to convert code to VHDL; simulate design, then integrate new hardware with the ARM processor.
- Implement hardware in the FPGA; create an application for data transfers.
- Analyze and present data; draw conclusions about the benefits of hardware acceleration.
