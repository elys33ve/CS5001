Project Topic:
We will research the benefit of migrating a compute-intensive software algorithm to hardware. This will include:
- software-only baseline
- hardware accelerated-implementation
- data analysis & visualization

Abstract:
This project will investigate the performance benefits of migrating compute-intensive algorithms from a software-only implementation to a hardware accelerator. We will first develop a benchmark CPU-only version, analyzing the performance and identifying performance bottlenecks. From there, using high-level synthesis (HLS), the algorithm will be converted to VHDL, simulated, and integrated with an ARM processor. The design will then be implemented on an FPGA, with an application developed to handle data transfers between the CPU and hardware accelerator. Finally, we will analyze and visualize the performance metrics to quantify improvements, and discuss the advantages and trade-offs of hardware acceleration.
