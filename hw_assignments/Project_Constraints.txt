Constraints Essay
Economic constraints: We are burrowing access to the hardware (UltraZed™-EG SOM
Hardware) and verification software (Aldec Riviera Pro) for this project from Fiona’s co-op
employer, Quasonix Inc. We will otherwise be relying on open-source software. There are no
other significant costs associated with this project.
Professional constraints: In theory, this project should be able to be completed with our own
skills, current experience, and some research. However, if we come across any problems
(especially regarding the hardware), we can contact and work with a specialist from Quasonix.
This project should have a positive impact on our professional development. Not only does it
give the members of our group to demonstrate our knowledge, but it also gives us a chance to
learn from the other members in our group and gain experience in other areas.
Environmental constraints: Our project is finding more efficient ways to run energy-intensive
algorithms via hardware acceleration. This would make these energy-intensive algorithms much
more energy-efficient. However, this comes at the cost of needing the hardware (in our case,
FPGAs) to run on.
