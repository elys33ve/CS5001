** add the research

1. Develop the CPU-only software implementation in C++ 
2. Implement the test vectors and datasets for validation and performance measurement.
3. Measure the baseline latency, throughput, and CPU usage of the C++ software on the ARM processor
4. Analyze the C++ software to identify the bottleneck for hardware migration.

5. Convert the bottleneck into synthesizable VHDL/Verilog code using the Vitis HLS tool.
6. Design the core architecture of the hardware accelerator
7. Validate the generated hardware IP core using a simulation testbench (Python's cocotb)
8. Create the Vivado block diagram to integrate the custom hardware IP core with the ARM processor and memory system.
9. Define the AXI-Lite interface and register map for sending control signals and retrieving status to/from the accelerator
10. Configure AXI interfaces for efficient data transfer between memory and the hardware accelerator
11. Document the memory and I/O mapping required for the host C++ application to communicate with the hardware IP

12. Synthesize, place, and route the complete integrated hardware design onto the Zynq FPGA fabric
13. Verify the generation of the bitstream and load the hardware configuration onto the Zynq board.
14. Develop the host C++ application for the ARM processor that calls the hardware accelerator and handles data buffer transfers
15. Refine the host application's data handling to ensure optimal data transfer rates across the AXI buses.

16. Test the end-to-end functionality of the hardware-accelerated system against the software baseline.
17. Measure latency and throughput metrics of the hardware-accelerated version running on the Zynq board.
18. Determine power consumption of the Zynq board during the execution of both the baseline and accelerated tests
19. Create visuals to present the quantifiable results of the hardware acceleration.
